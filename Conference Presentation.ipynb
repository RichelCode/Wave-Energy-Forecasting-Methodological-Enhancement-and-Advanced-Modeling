    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a comprehensive wave energy forecasting system that addresses critical methodological limitations in existing literature while advancing toward state-of-the-art performance. Our work builds upon and significantly improves the methodology presented in TIefu et al. (2021), incorporating:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Improvements:\n",
    "- Rigorous time series cross-validation (eliminating data leakage)\n",
    "- Spatial imputation using neighbor station data (preserving temporal continuity)\n",
    "- Comprehensive feature engineering with temporal lags and domain knowledge\n",
    "- Systematic hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian methods\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing for model comparisons\n",
    "- Neural network baselines (LSTM, GRU) alongside tree-based methods\n",
    "- Probabilistic forecasting with uncertainty quantification\n",
    "- Multi-horizon evaluation (1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h ahead)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Context and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "###  The Wave Energy Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave energy represents a **largely untapped renewable resource** with estimated potential of:\n",
    "- **1,170 TWh/year** along US coastlines (EPRI, 2011)\n",
    "- **2-3 TW global theoretical capacity** (Gunn & Stock-Williams, 2012)\n",
    "- **Predictable and high energy density** compared to wind/solar\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **grid integration of wave energy** requires accurate forecasting for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Power System Operations:**\n",
    "   - Unit commitment and economic dispatch optimization\n",
    "   - Spinning reserve allocation\n",
    "   - Transmission congestion management\n",
    "   - Ancillary service procurement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wave Energy Converter (WEC) Management:**\n",
    "   - Preventive maintenance scheduling during calm periods\n",
    "   - Survival mode activation before extreme events\n",
    "   - Optimal power extraction strategies\n",
    "   - Component lifetime optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Market Participation:**\n",
    "   - Day-ahead and real-time market bidding\n",
    "   - Financial risk management\n",
    "   - Revenue optimization under uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Forecasting Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave energy flux (kW/m) depends primarily on:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significant Wave Height (H_s):** \n",
    "- The mean height of the highest 1/3 of waves in a time period\n",
    "- Directly measured by buoy accelerometers\n",
    "- Energy ∝ H_s² (quadratic relationship amplifies forecast errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wave Period (T):**\n",
    "- Dominant Period (DPD): Period of peak energy in wave spectrum\n",
    "- Average Period (APD): Mean period of all waves\n",
    "- Energy ∝ T (linear relationship but crucial for power capture)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wave Energy Flux Formula:**\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{\\rho g^2 H_s^2 T}{64\\pi} \\approx 0.49 H_s^2 T \\text{ (kW/m in deep water)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- ρ = seawater density ≈ 1025 kg/m³\n",
    "- g = gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s²\n",
    "- H_s = significant wave height (m)\n",
    "- T = wave period (s)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:** A 10% error in H_s translates to ~20% error in energy flux due to quadratic relationship. This demands high-accuracy forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review and Research Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physics-Based Models:**\n",
    "- WAVEWATCH III, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore)\n",
    "- **Pros:** Based on first principles, global applicability\n",
    "- **Cons:** Computationally expensive (hours for 24h forecast), require accurate wind forcing, cumulative error from physics approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical/ML Models:**\n",
    "- ARIMA, SARIMA for time series\n",
    "- Neural Networks (ANN, LSTM, GRU)\n",
    "- Tree-based methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)\n",
    "- **Pros:** Fast inference, learn from data patterns\n",
    "- **Cons:** Site-specific training, require substantial historical data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid Models:**\n",
    "- Decomposition + ML (VMD-LSTM, EMD-XGBoost)\n",
    "- Stacking ensembles combining multiple algorithms\n",
    "- Physics-informed neural networks\n",
    "- **Pros:** Leverage complementary strengths\n",
    "- **Cons:** Increased complexity, hyperparameter tuning challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identified Research Gaps (TIefu et al., 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "After thorough review of the foundational paper, we identified **critical methodological deficiencies:**\n",

    "| Point predictions only | No uncertainty quantification | Quantile regression, conformal prediction |\n",
    "| Single horizon evaluation | Limited operational utility | Multi-horizon [1, 3, 6, 12, 24h] |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our work systematically addresses each of these gaps.**\n",

    "# Final Decision on Study Period and Neighbour Use\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Why 2019–2024 Was Rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially tried to use the 2019–2024 period for both the target station (41025 – Diamond Shoals) and the neighbour station (41001 – East Hatteras) so that we could perform spatial imputation with full temporal overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the data quality analysis for 2019–2024 at 41025 showed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extremely high missingness for key wave variables:\n",
    "  - Significant wave height (WVHT)\n",
    "  - Average wave period (APD)\n",
    "  - Dominant wave period (DPD)\n",
    "  - Wind speed (WSPD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after applying neighbour-based imputation using 41001, only a small fraction of these missing values could be filled:\n",
    "\n",
    "- About 17,500 timestamps were imputed, but over 230,000 remained missing for WVHT/APD/DPD.\n",
    "- Post-imputation missingness for these variables remained around 77–80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, for 2019–2024:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 41025 record is **too sparse** to support robust time-series modeling.\n",
    "- Any machine learning model trained on this period would be dominated by missing data and imputation artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a statistical and scientific standpoint, this makes 2019–2024 unsuitable as the primary study period for forecasting at Diamond Shoals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returning to 2014–2019 for 41025\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper used **2014–2019** for station 41025. Our new analysis confirms that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2014–2019 at 41025 has substantially **better coverage** of WVHT, APD, DPD, and WSPD.\n",
    "- This period provides enough continuous data to:\n",
    "  - Build lagged features,\n",
    "  - Train and validate time-series models,\n",
    "  - Evaluate multi-horizon forecasts in a statistically meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we explicitly **adopt 2014–2019 at 41025 as the main study period** for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research focus remains:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Accurate wave energy forecasting at Diamond Shoals (Station 41025),  \n",
    "> with improved methodology over the original paper (validation, feature engineering, model comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role of Neighbour Station 41001\n",
    "\n",
    "Station 41001 (East Hatteras) remains valuable but plays a **supporting role**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 41001 will be used **only for optional imputation** in years where:\n",
    "  - 41025 has gaps, and\n",
    "  - 41001 has overlapping observations for the same timestamps.\n",
    "- We will not force 41001 into every year or every gap.\n",
    "- We will not use 41001 directly as a predictor in the forecasting models for 41025; its role is purely to help clean up missing values where justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "If 41001 does not overlap sufficiently with 41025 in some years (e.g., early 2014), we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leave those gaps as they are, or\n",
    "- Use simple, local methods (short-range interpolation or forward fill/backward fill) for small gaps,\n",
    "- But we will **not** over-impute using distant or weakly related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the modeling remains grounded in actual 41025 measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Study Setup Going Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onward in the notebook, we adopt the following setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target station:** 41025 (Diamond Shoals, NC)\n",
    "- **Primary study period:** 2014-01-01 to 2019-12-31\n",
    "- **Neighbour station:** 41001 (East Hatteras), used only opportunistically for imputation where:\n",
    "  - timestamps overlap with 41025, and\n",
    "  - correlations are strong (especially for WVHT, APD, DPD, WSPD).\n",
    "\n",
    "All subsequent steps (gap analysis, imputation, feature engineering, train/validation/test splits, and model development) will be based on this **2014–2019 target dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep the earlier 2019–2024 experiments in the notebook for transparency, but they are no longer part of the main analysis pipeline.\n"

    "### Final Missing-Data Strategy (Leakage-Free, Spatial + Temporal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use spatial information from Station 41002 to improve the 41025 record while avoiding data leakage and keeping the forecasting setup publication‑grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt the following plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-based splitting before imputation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We split the 41025 record into:\n",
    "     - Train: 2014‑01‑01 to 2017‑12‑31  \n",
    "     - Validation: 2018‑01‑01 to 2018‑12‑31  \n",
    "     - Test: 2019‑01‑01 to 2019‑12‑31  \n",
    "   - All imputation models are trained **only** on the train period and then applied to val and test, so no future information from 2018–2019 leaks into training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spatial imputation using neighbour 41002**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - On the train split, we build simple regression models of the form  \n",
    "     \\( \\text{var}_{41025}(t) \\approx f(\\text{var}_{41002}(t)) \\)  \n",
    "     for WVHT, APD, DPD, and WSPD using only overlapping train data.\n",
    "   - We then apply these frozen models to train, val, and test to fill values at 41025 **only when**:\n",
    "     - 41025 is missing, and  \n",
    "     - 41002 has an observation at the same timestamp.\n",
    "   - This step reduces missingness, especially for WSPD, and uses spatial information in a way that is realistic for real‑time deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Short-gap temporal imputation in train only**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After spatial imputation, about 14% of WVHT/APD/DPD in the train set are still missing.\n",
    "   - For the **training split only**, we apply short-gap temporal interpolation (e.g., up to 6 hours) to fill these remaining small gaps.\n",
    "   - Long gaps that cannot be reliably interpolated are left missing and later dropped.\n",
    "   - This makes the training data denser without affecting the integrity of validation and test evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conservative handling of validation and test**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For validation and test, we **do not** apply any additional temporal interpolation to the target beyond spatial imputation.\n",
    "   - We identify the longest continuous segments in 2018 and 2019 where WVHT is present (original or spatially imputed) and use those segments as our evaluation windows.\n",
    "   - Within these windows, we drop any timestamps where WVHT or key predictors (e.g., WSPD, PRES, ATMP, WTMP) are still missing.\n",
    "   - As a result, model performance is evaluated only on times where the target is genuinely observable (or spatially reconstructed), with no use of future values for imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Train: spatial imputation (41002 → 41025) + short-gap temporal interpolation, then drop any remaining missing WVHT.\n",
    "   - Validation/Test: spatial imputation only; select continuous segments with available WVHT and drop remaining missing rows.\n",
    "   - The neighbour station is used **only** for imputation, never as a direct predictor in forecasting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy balances the use of spatial information, strict control of data leakage, and practical handling of high missingness, aligning with recent best practices in time-series imputation and forecasting.\n"

    "### From Spatial Imputation to Final Modeling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the 41025 time series into three calendar periods:\n",
    "  - 2014–2017 (initially planned as train),\n",
    "  - 2018 (initially planned as validation),\n",
    "  - 2019 (initially planned as test).\n",
    "- Built **spatial regression models** using Station 41002 to predict missing values at Station 41025.\n",
    "- Applied these models to each split, filling any timestamp where 41025 was missing but 41002 was observed.\n",
    "- Measured the remaining missingness in the key variables (WVHT, APD, DPD, WSPD) after spatial imputation:\n",
    "  - Train (2014–2017): about 14% missing in WVHT/APD/DPD, almost 0% in WSPD.\n",
    "  - Val (2018): about 82% missing in WVHT/APD/DPD.\n",
    "  - Test (2019): about 83% missing in WVHT/APD/DPD.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then searched for **continuous segments of non-missing WVHT** in 2018 and 2019 and found that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The longest WVHT segments in 2018 and 2019 are only **2 hours long**.\n",
    "- This means there is essentially **no substantial continuous WVHT record** available for quantitative validation or testing at Station 41025 during 2018–2019, even after spatial imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, using 2018–2019 as formal validation and test sets would force us to evaluate forecasting models on mostly imputed targets, which is statistically weak and not suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Methods We Adopt Going Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a rigorous and defensible forecasting study, we adopt the following strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Core modeling dataset (2014–2017)**  \n",
    "   - We focus on the 2014–2017 period at Station 41025, where spatial imputation plus short-gap temporal interpolation produce a dense and reliable record.\n",
    "   - After:\n",
    "     - applying neighbour-based spatial imputation from 41002, and\n",
    "     - applying short-gap temporal interpolation (up to a small number of hours) in 2014–2017,\n",
    "     - we removed any remaining rows with missing WVHT.\n",
    "   - The resulting dataset `df25_train_clean` has:\n",
    "     - 0% missing WVHT,\n",
    "     - 0% missing APD, DPD, and WSPD,\n",
    "     - and a complete set of meteorological predictors (PRES, ATMP, WTMP, MWD, WDIR, etc.).\n",
    "   - This clean dataset forms the **basis for all model training and quantitative evaluation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rolling time-series cross-validation within 2014–2017**  \n",
    "   - Instead of using 2018 and 2019 as standard validation/test years, we evaluate models using **rolling cross-validation** on the 2014–2017 period.  \n",
    "   - Example folds:\n",
    "     - Fold 1: train on 2014–2015, validate on 2016.\n",
    "     - Fold 2: train on 2014–2016, validate on 2017.\n",
    "   - This approach:\n",
    "     - preserves temporal order,\n",
    "     - uses only real (or spatially reconstructed) WVHT at 41025,\n",
    "     - and provides robust performance estimates without relying on sparsely observed future years.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Role of Station 41002 (spatial imputation only)**  \n",
    "   - Station 41002 is used **only** for spatial imputation, not as a predictor in forecasting models.\n",
    "   - Spatial regression models 41002 → 41025 are trained solely on 2014–2017 (train years) and then applied within that period to fill gaps.\n",
    "   - We quantify the effect of this step by reporting:\n",
